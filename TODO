TODO:

-> // FIXED // Get volume control working
-> Check compatibility across HTML5 Video capable browsers
		-> Fix opera range rendering?
-> // FIXED // Fix keyboard accessibility for range controls so space pauses video, left/up cursor and right/down cursor keys advance/rewind video significantly
-> // FIXED // Add another keyboard accessibility fix so that controls fade in when a keyboard event within that video container is fired, and set a 5-10sec timer to fade out.
-> Double check ARIA roles etc
-> Build a flash front-end
-> Check with screen reader
-> Add the ability to click on the track to seek to that point in the video
-> Pinch gesture for iOS
-> // FIXED // Load progress display on range control (Doing first, because this will change the way some other things are implemented)
